For now I have not used the values we enter in the text box for source and destiation locations. 
I've hardcoded those two values cause Shivam has created a UI which uses something like that to interactively get location using geoCoding.
Thus, we will use that one for getting the original source and destination of the user.

Rest all is fine and woring good.
